[Verse 1]
F/C            C
I searched the world
    F/C         C
But it couldn't fill me
             Am
Man's empty praise
                    G
and treasures that fade
              F
(are) never enough

[Verse 2]
               C
Then You came along
    F/C           C
And put me back together
            Am              G
And every desire is now satisfied
             F
Here in Your love

[Chorus]
           C
Oh there's nothing better than You
        Am
There's nothing better than You
             F
Lord there's nothing
                       C
Nothing is better than You

[Verse 3]
F/C       C
I'm not afraid
   F/C         C
To show You my weakness
                Am
My failures and flaws
                      G
Lord You've seen them all
                      F
And You still call me friend

[Verse 4]
                      C
'Cause the God of the mountain
      F/C        C
Is the God of the valley
              Am
There's not a place
               G
Your mercy and grace
               F
Won't find me again

[Chorus]
           C
Oh there's nothing better than You
            Am
Oh, there's nothing better than You
             F
Lord there's nothing
                       C
Nothing is better than You

[Bridge 1]
C                               F  C
  You turn mourning to dancing
                          F  C
You give beauty for ashes
                          F
You turn shame into glory
           Am  F       C
You're the only one who can

[Bridge 2]
C                              F  C
  You turn graves into gardens
                           F  C
You turn bones into armies
                            F
You turn seas into highways
           Am  F       C
You're the only one who can

[Chorus]
           C
Oh there's nothing better than You
             Am
Lord there's nothing better than You
           F
Oh there's nothing
                       C
Nothing is better than You

[Chorus]
           C
Oh there's nothing better than You
           Am
Oh there's nothing better than You
             F
Lord there's nothing
                       C
Nothing is better than You

[Bridge 2]
C                              F  C
  You turn graves into gardens
                           F  C
You turn bones into armies
                             F
You turn seas into highways
           Am  F       C
You're the only one who can
           Am  F       C
You're the only one who can
           Am  F       C     F  C
You're the only one who can
