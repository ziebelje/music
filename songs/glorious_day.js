[Breakdown]
G

// Let ring. Come in on "I have a future"

[Bridge]
G
I needed rescue, my sin was heavy
G
But chains break at the weight of Your glory
G
I needed shelter, I was an orphan
G
Now You call me a citizen of Heaven

G
When I was broken You were my healing
G
Now Your love is the air that I'm breathing
Em7
I have a future
Dsus4
my eyes are open

[Chorus]
                     Csus2

into Your glorious day
              Csus2
You called my name
