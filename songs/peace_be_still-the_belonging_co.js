[Intro]
A  A  F#m7  Esus
A  A  F#m7  Esus

[Verse 1]
                    A
I don't want to be afraid

Every time I face the waves
                    F#m7
I don't want to be afraid
                    Esus
I don't want to be afraid
                         A
I don't want to fear the storm

Just because I hear it roar
                         F#m7
I don't want to fear the storm
                         Esus
I don't want to fear the storm

[Chorus]
Dsus2
Peace be still
        Esus
Say the word and I will
       F#m7
Set my feet upon the sea
         A/C#
Till I'm dancing in the deep
    Dsus2
Oh, peace be still
        Esus
You are here so it is well
     F#m7
Even when my eyes can't see
       A/C#                         Dsus2
I will trust the voice that speaks

[Verse 2]
                  A
I'm not gonna be afraid

'Cause these waves are only waves
                      F#m7
Oh, I'm not gonna be afraid
                  Esus
I'm not gonna be afraid
                       A
I'm not gonna fear the storm

You are greater than its roar
                       F#m7
I'm not gonna fear the storm
                          Esus
Oh, I'm not gonna fear at all, yeah

[Chorus]
Dsus2
Peace be still
        Esus
Say the word and I will
       F#m7
Set my feet upon the sea
         A/C#
Till I'm dancing in the deep
    Dsus2
Oh, peace be still
        Esus
You are here so it is well
     F#m7
Even when my eyes can't see
       A/C#                         Dsus2
I will trust the voice that speaks

[Interlude]
Dsus2  Esus        F#m7  A/C#  Dsus2
Peace, peace, over me

[Bridge]
    Dsus2
Let faith rise up
   Esus
Oh heart believe
    A/C#                 Dsus2
Let faith rise up in me

// Repeat 4x

[Chorus]
Dsus2
Peace be still
        Esus
Say the word and I will
       F#m7
Set my feet upon the sea
         A/C#
Till I'm dancing in the deep
    Dsus2
Oh, peace be still
        Esus
You are here so it is well
     F#m7
Even when my eyes can't see
       A/C#                         Dsus2
I will trust the voice that speaks

Peace, peace, over me
