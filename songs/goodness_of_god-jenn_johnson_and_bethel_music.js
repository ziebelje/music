I love you, Lord

For your mercy never fails me
D/F#   Em              C            D
All my days, I’ve been held in your hands
                       Em       C
From the moment that I wake up
       G   D/F#  Em
Till I lay my    head

I will sing of the goodness of God

You have led me through the fire

In darkest night you are close like no other
                    Em     C
I’ve known you as a father
                    G  D/F#  Em

With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now

  Your goodness is running after,

It’s running after me
