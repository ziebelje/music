G  C  G
D  C  G

[Verse 1]
G           C                 G
Maybe today this could be the day
D                         C       G
Put those boots on and go hiking away
G                         C         G
Cast a line of hope while fishing today
    D                      C      G
But work keeps pushing the hours away

[Chorus 1]
G                          C        G
Looking for pieces in this house of me
D                             C       G
Corridors and closets where I used to be
G                            C          G
I ain't seen myself in these mirrors so long
       D                    C        G
Just a dust covered picture hanging alone
       D                    C        G
Just a dust covered picture hanging alone

[Verse 2]
G                                  C       G
My favorite horse named Johnny was my best friend
D                 C              G
Rode him all over smilin' like a kid
G                   C     G
Fun times been over oh so long
D                             C     G
Funny I didn't even know that I was gone

[Chorus 1]
G                          C        G
Looking for pieces in this house of me
D                             C       G
Corridors and closets where I used to be
G                            C          G
I ain't seen myself in these mirrors so long
       D                    C        G
Just a dust covered picture hanging alone
       D                    C        G
Just a dust covered picture hanging alone

[Verse 3]
G                         C     G
Haven't seen my friend in LA in years
D             C                G
Ten hour days keep my friends away
G                                 C               G
Instead of pushin' hours I'll get this guitar and play
D                          C        G
All this crap can wait I'm livin' today

[Chorus 2]
G                                  C        G
I'm not looking for pieces in this house of me
D                            C       G
All the doors are open I can finally see
G                         C        G
I can see myself in these mirrors again
       D                           C        G
I just hung a brand new picture of me and a friend
       D                           C        G
I just hung a brand new picture of me and a friend
       D                           C        G
I just hung a brand new picture of me and a friend`
