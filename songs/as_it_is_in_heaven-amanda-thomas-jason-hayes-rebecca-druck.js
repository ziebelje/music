[Verse 1]
We can see Heaven coming down

Fill us

We can see angels all around

Join us

We can see ? from every ?

Unite us

And we can see brokenness restored

Heal us

[Chorus]
D           F#m G
Thy kingdom come
                   Em
Thy will be done on earth
            Bm  A
As it is in Heaven
D           F#m G
We lift our hands
                   Em
We lift our hearts oh God
            Bm  A  D
As it is in Heaven

[Verse 2]
We can see Jesus on his throne

He's Worthy

Heavenly Father be made known

You're Holy

Holy Spirit take Control

And lead us

Oh Holy Spirit speak right now 

And ignite us


[Chorus]
Thy kingdom come

Thy will be done on earth

As it is in Heaven

We lift our hands

We lift our hearts oh God
Bm A G
As it is in Heaven

// Repeat 2x

[Instrumental]
