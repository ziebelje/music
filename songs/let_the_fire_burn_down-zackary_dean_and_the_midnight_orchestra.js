[Verse 1]
Em      C                  G
Stealin glances across the room
   Em              C           G
No words are heard baby I love yours
      Em
And I can't help but thinkin
C                 G                   D
Wishin of dreamin all the things with you
    Em
And your hands pressed
C                G            D
against my chest across my tattoos

[Chorus]
           C              G
Let's stay home all night long
          D           Em
Wrap your arms around this ?
          C                G
Let these words come right through
           D      Em
Girl all I see is you
C                                      G
I don't know what you're thinkin about right now
D                                Em
But you're the only thing I want
C  G  D
???
Let the fire burn down

[Interlude]
Em  C  G

[Verse 2]
Em  C  G
I know what you've been thinkin too
Em  C  G
... moonlit room
Em
Girl come a little closer
C  G  D
show a little shoulder girl I want to stay with you
Em
And no sense running
C  G  D
my heart's

[Chorus]
           C              G
Let's stay home all night long
          D           Em
Wrap your arms around this ?
          C                G
Let these words come right through
           D      Em
Girl all I see is you
C                                      G
I don't know what you're thinkin about right now
D                                Em
But you're the only thing I want
C  G  D

[Chorus]

Wrap your arms around this ?

Let these words come right through
           D      Em
Girl all I see is you
C                                      G
I don't know what you're thinkin about right now
D                                Em
