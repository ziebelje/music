[Verse 1a]
             C
Christ is my firm foundation
    Am              G
The rock on which I stand
                 C
When everything around me is shaken
     Am              G
I've never been more glad
              F           C/E
That I put my faith in Jesus
            Am           G
'Cause He's never let me down
                      F       C/E
He's faithful through generations
   Am              G
So why would He fail now
