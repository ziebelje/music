G  D/F#  Em  C
G  D/F#  Em  C

[Verse 1]
    G          D/F#
Two wheels two hearts
Em                       C
Nothin' but open road is where it starts
      G          D/F#
Truck beds clear sky
Em                 C
Not a single cloud in sight

[Pre-Chorus]
         Em                         D/F#     C
Thinkin' I want all the things with      you
Em                    D/F#      C
Wishin' every day was      with   you

[Chorus 1]
        G
I'll be holdin' your hand
    D/F#
And chasing you around
Em                    D
Where it don't matter long as we're together
      C
We'll run this town
    G
And kiss under the tree
D/F#
Twirl under the moon
Em                  D                 C
Hopin' that forever turns out like we want it to
     C
Yeah we can hope to

[Verse 2]
     G        D/F#
Bare feet old jeep
Em                       C
Cruisin' down the road nowhere to be
   G         D/F#
Sunsets rear view
Em                           C
Girl it don't matter long as I'm with you

[Pre-Chorus]
         Em                         D/F#     C
Thinkin' I want all the things with      you
Em                    D/F#      C
Wishin' every day was      with   you

[Chorus 1]
        G
I'll be holdin' your hand
    D/F#
And chasing you around
Em                    D
Where it don't matter long as we're together
      C
We'll run this town
    G
And kiss under the tree
D/F#
Twirl under the moon
Em                  D                 C
Hopin' that forever turns out like we want it to
     C
Yeah we can hope to

Em                    D/F#      C
Wishin' every day was      with   you

[Chorus 2]
        G
I'll be holdin' your hand

And chasing you around
Em                    D
