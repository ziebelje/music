[Verse 1]
Cmaj7
  I don't believe in fairy tales
Cmaj7
  I guess I've outgrown them
Cmaj7
  But that doesn't mean that I don't believe
Cmaj7                                F2
  That there's something bigger than me
                        D7sus
Cause I've seen it in a hospital room

When the doctors said
       Gsus                         G
"Sorry  there's nothing more we can do"
               Cmaj7
Well it wasn't through

[Verse 2]
Cmaj7
  I've never seen a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow
Cmaj7
  But I've got a promise I can hold
Cmaj7
  In the middle of the struggle
F2                             D7sus
  God if you said it You'll perform it
                          Gsus
May not be how I want You to
                     G
But here's what I'll do

[Chorus 1]
                       C
I'm gonna wait on You
                       D7sus
I'm gonna wait on You
                 Am7  C  Gsus
I've tasted Your goodness
                   F2
I'll trust in Your promise
D7sus                 Cmaj7
I'm gonna wait on You

[Verse 3]
Cmaj7
  I know You've ordered every step
Cmaj7
  Yeah, You are the Author
Cmaj7
  And there's no predicting what is next
Cmaj7
  But You hold the future
F2                                D7sus
  And all the questions they come second
                     Gsus
To the one I know is true
                   G
You've always been true

[Chorus 2]
                       C
I'm gonna wait on You
                       D7sus
I'm gonna wait on You
                 Am7  C  Gsus
I've tasted Your goodness
                   F2
I'll trust in Your promise

                       C
I'm gonna wait on You
                       D7sus
I'm gonna wait on You
                 Am7  C  Gsus
I've tasted Your goodness

F2/A        Gsus

[Bridge 2]
          F2
They that wait on the Lord
        Gsus
Shall renew their strength
           F2
They shall mount up, up on wings
        Gsus
Like an eagle, and they soar
           F2
They shall walk, and not get weary
           Gsus
They shall run, and not faint
                             C
That's what happens when you wait

                         C
That's what happens when you wait
                         C
That's what happens when you wait
            G            C
That's what happens when you wait
                         C
That's what happens when you wait
            G            C
That's what happens when you wait
