Am   G/B    C      G      F

[Verse 1]
Am                 G/B      C
   You call me out upon the waters
            G                    F
The great unknown where feet may fail
Am                      G/B    C
   And there I find You in the mystery
          G                  F
In oceans deep My faith will stand

[Chorus]
F            C              G
  And I will call upon Your name
F              C             G
  And keep my eyes above the waves
            F
When oceans rise
             C              G
My soul will rest in your embrace
         F         G       Am
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
               G                  F
Your sovereign hand   Will be my guide
Am                      G/B      C
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
             G                       F
You've never failed and you won't start now

[Chorus]
F            C              G
  And I will call upon Your name
F              C             G
  And keep my eyes above the waves
            F
When oceans rise
             C              G
My soul will rest in your embrace
         F         G       Am
For I am Yours and You are mine
