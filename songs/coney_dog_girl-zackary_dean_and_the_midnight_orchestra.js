E
Every small town has that girl
        B
that'll melt your heart and wreck your world
F#m                                A
Just one look can stop you in your tracks
E
I've seen her once and you have too
B
Eyes a shade of bellow blue
F#m
I don't mind boots and brunette hair
A
Lord I couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
        E
She's a coney dog girl in a white t-shirt
B
Hair's a mess up when she flirts
F#m
Flashin' that smile that lights up
     A          B
This whole dang town
        E
She's a jack & coke but hold the coke
B
Hurricaine and a little smoke
F#m                            A
Gone don't mean what you think it means
           F#m         G#m      A              B
Yeah she's stubborn, impatient, beautiful, and crazy

F#m  G#m A
Yeah

E  F#m  G#m  A  B  A
That's my baby

E  F#m  G#m  A  B  A`
