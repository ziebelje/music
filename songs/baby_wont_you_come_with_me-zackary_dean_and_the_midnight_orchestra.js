G

[Verse 1]
G
Sittin' there with a beautiful view
                             C
Of a Georgia sunset long overdue its overdue
G
Take my hand we'll walk together
                               C            G
Down this road we call forever baby take my hand

[Pre-Chorus 1]
D                             C
I can see the running in your eyes
D                 C
Like a horse in a fire

[Chorus 1]
G
Come with me we'll walk through wildflowers
C                                      Em
Come with me we'll go without stopping love
             C
You're all I need
                         G
Baby Won't you come with me

[Verse 2]
G
Girl I don't know what you're thinking
                                C                 G
All I know is what I'm feeling, baby I'm ready to go
G
Lets gas that truck up and hit the road
                             C                   G
Lets just see how far we go, darlin I'm ready to roll

[Pre-Chorus]
D                     C
We could sit here all night
D                         C
Or we could run, into the wild

[Chorus 2]
G
Come with me we'll walk through wildflowers
C                                      Em
Come with me we'll go without stopping love
             C
You're all I need

G
Open road rollin down the freeway
C                                             Em
Don't know where we're goin' but we're gettin' away

You're all I need

Baby won't you come with me
